# Should-I-Wear-Shorts-Today

Before man enters the outdoors he always wonders whether or not he can wear shorts or if he has to wear pants. 
This website can now tell mankind if they should wear pants or shorts before having to brace the elements of mother nature.

Simple webiste made after a hack-a-thon idea fell threw. Uses simpleweather.js api for weather data. 
Logic for wheather(pun) to wear shorts or not is simple if it is greater than 60 degrees (I made this in the winter) and 
raining, snowing, hail, etc.
